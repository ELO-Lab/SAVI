# Simulated Annealing with Dynamic Programming-based Vertex Insertion for Efficiently Solving the Travelling Thief Problem
This project is a java implementation of heuristic algorithms to solve
the [Travelling Thief Problem](http://cs.adelaide.edu.au/~optlog/research/combinatorial.php).

## Contributors

## Environment
- Programing language: Java 11+
- IDEA: IntelliJ IDEA 2022.2.1+
- OS: Linux (Ubuntu 22.04.3 LTS)

## Algorithms
SAVI (based on Stimulated Annealing with Vertex Insertion)

## Set up
Clone this repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/hoangnqh/TTP-SAVI.git
```

## Instruction
Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA with the previously mentioned environment and run it by executing the CLI class or running multiple instances sequentially using the 'run.py' file with the following command:
```bash
python3 run.py
```

## Notes
Due to space constraint, TTP instances have been removed from the repository. You can find them at: [TTP instances](http://cs.adelaide.edu.au/~optlog/CEC2014COMP_InstancesNew/)
